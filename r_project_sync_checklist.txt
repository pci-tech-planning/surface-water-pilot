# R Project Sync & Reproducibility Checklist

This checklist helps ensure your renv-based R project can be cloned, restored, and run reproducibly across machines or collaborators.

## ✅ Before Syncing or Sharing

1. 🔒 **Snapshot dependencies**
   ```r
   renv::snapshot()
   ```
   - Ensures your `renv.lock` is current and accurate.

2. 📦 **Exclude unnecessary files**
   - Confirm that `.gitignore` excludes:
     - `renv/library/`
     - `.RData`, `.Rhistory`, `.Rproj.user/`, and output files (`.html`, `.pdf`, etc.)

3. 📤 **Push your GitHub repo**
   - Include:
     - `renv.lock`
     - `renv/activate.R`
     - `.Rproj`
     - Your scripts, data, Quarto files, etc.

## 🔄 When Cloning on Another Machine

1. 📁 **Clone the repo**
   - Use GitHub Desktop or `git clone` into your working directory

2. 📂 **Open the `.Rproj` file** in RStudio

3. 🔄 **Restore the environment**
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```
   - This will install all packages listed in `renv.lock`

4. 🧪 **Test the build**
   - Run the key scripts or Quarto files to verify everything works:
     ```r
     source("analysis.R")
     quarto::render("report.qmd")
     ```

## 🧼 Optional Tips

- To isolate your work from your global R setup:
  - Avoid using global packages; always work within the project
- If working with collaborators:
  - Encourage them to run `renv::restore()` after cloning

---

## ✅ That's it!
With this setup, your project should behave the same on any machine with R and RStudio installed.
